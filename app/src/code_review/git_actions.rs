//! Shared git "action" orchestration: the commit-chain, push, create-PR, and
//! view-PR workflows behind the code-review git buttons.
//!
//! These compose the single-command primitives in [`crate::util::git`] into the
//! end-to-end actions a button triggers.
//! They are intentionally backend-agnostic: the local code-review dialog and
//! the remote-server daemon both call them, so local and remote behave
//! identically. Git ops are host-scoped and not tied to a diff-state model, so
//! this logic lives here rather than on a model.
//!
//! Callers own everything *around* the action: UI (toasts, telemetry, dialog
//! lifecycle), transport/model (applying the returned delta to a
//! `DiffStateModel`, building wire responses), and any execution-time guards
//! (e.g. the daemon's `git_operation_in_progress` backstop).
